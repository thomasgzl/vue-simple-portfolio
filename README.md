# :gear: Description

This is a developer portfolio template built with **Vue.js**. Knowledge of Vue is not required to use this template! Simply follow these instructions carefully to properly populate your own portfolio data.

> This template is fully mobile-responsive!

![home](./public/images/home.png)

I made this README extremely detailed, but I promise getting setup is easy-peasy!

# :hammer_and_wrench: Install & Setup

## Get Up & Running :running:

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone the new repo to your machine
3. Run `npm i` to install dependencies
4. Run `npm run serve` to start the development serve
5. View your portfolio at `http://localhost:8080`

## Making It Yours (TLDR;) :sparkles:

1. Update all of the [Images](#content):

- replace `favicon.ico`(or delete)
- replace `header-background.jpg`
- replace `logo.png` (or delete)
- add images to the `potfolio/`directory

2. Update the [Content](#content) from the `.json` file

3. Create a [contact form](#form) using [99inbound](https://app.99inbound.com/)

4. Update the [Styling](#styling) by updating Sass variables

## Lay of the Land :desert_island:

- Favicon is stored in `/public/favicon.ico`
- All other images are found in `/src/assets/images`
- Your content will be updated from `/src/data/data.json`
- You can update basic styling such as colors by updating the variables explained in `/src/styles/scss/abstract/_variables.scss`
- Update `index.html` with a title and meta descriptions
- You should fill everything out unless it's indicated as _optional_

  > If you choose not to fill out an _optional_ item, then leave it blank in `data.json` with an empty string `""`

# :pencil: Details for Populating Portfolio

## Meta :gear:

<details>
<summary>Steps</summary>

- In `/public/index.html` you will see `<meta>` properties commented out. Uncomment them and fill them out as apporiate (_optional_)

> Necessary if you plan on making your portfolio searchable in Google and optimizing for SEO.

- Similarly, fill out the `<title>` tags with your name or a title of your choice.
  </details>

## Images :camera:

### Favicon

<details>
<summary>Steps</summary>
- Delete the existing favicon.ico (Note this sometimes takes a while to update on the development server)

- Replace favicon.ico in the `/public` directory with your own favicon (_optional_)

> The Favicon needs to be in a `.ico` format. If you have a `.png` you would like to use you can convert it to `.ico` with an online converter such as this one [here](https://icoconvert.com/).

</details>

### Logo

<details>
<summary>Steps</summary>
- Delete `logo.png` from the assets folder

- Add a new `logo.png` file (_optional_)

> If you do not add another logo.png, you first & last name will display in the 'navbar-brand' area

</details>

### Other Images

**All other images can be found in `src/assets/images`**

> Be sure to keep the same filename and extension for the header-background, profile-pic, & logo.

- In the portfolio folder, add photos to represent your projects

> Naming your files with readable filenames is good practice for SEO.

**Recommended Sizes**

- `header-background.jpg` - A large hero image, at least 1200px wide, but no larger than 1900px.
- `profile-pic.png` - This should be a 1:1 aspect ratio. It will be reduced to 300px.
- `/portfolio` - Recommended aspect ratio of 5:3

## Content :pencil2:

- Nearly all text content is populated via `/src/data/data.json`

_The majority of the properties should be self-explanatory. I have outlined some details below._

### Main

<details>
<summary>Properties (Click to expand)</summary>

- **"titles"** - Refers to the typewriter effect in the hero. Enter an unlimited amount of strings in the array.

- **"logo"** - `true/false`: Enter `true` if you have populated a `logo.png` file. Enter `false` if you prefer to display your first & last name. If you deleted `logo.png` this **must** be **false**.

- **"headings"** - these populate the h1 for each section (eg. "About", "Skills", etc.)
  </details>

### About

![about](./public/images/about.png)

<details>
<summary>Properties (Click to expand)</summary>

- **"tagline"** - Include an h2 under the h1 in your About section (_optional_)

- **"facts"** - This is an array of objects. You can enter an unlimited amount of items here, with the recommended max being 6. These populate as list items as key-value pairs in the About section.
  </details>

### Skills

![skills](./public/images/skills.png)

<details>
<summary>Properties (Click to expand)</summary>

- **"defaultCategory"** - This is the skill category that will display when the page loads. This must match one of the categories listed exactly. There should not be duplicate categories (required).

* **"categories"** - This is an array of objects and you can add an unlimited amount of objects. Each "category" will appear as a filter in the Skills section. Categories should be unique.
  - **"category"** - You can break your skills up by category (eg. Front-End, Back-End, etc.)
  - **"faClass"** - add classes for a [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icon to represent the category

- **"subtitle"** - Add a blurb about the category (_optional_)

* **"skillsList"** - This is an array of objects. These populate as "skill bars" for each skill category. Enter a _"name"_ for the skill (eg. HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc.) and a _"level"_
  - The **level** should be a value of 0-100 in a multiple of 10 (ie. 100, 90, 80, etc) that represents the width the bar will be filled for each skill.

> Reccommended max: 4 skills in each skill list to keep the section height within the viewport.

> Tip: The skill names are rendered via HTML. You could group similar skills together and separate them with an HTML entity.

> - _Example: `'Javascript &bull; jQuery'` --> Javascript &bull; jQuery_

</details>

</details>

## **IMPORTANT SETUP FOR CONTACT FORM** :email:

Because this is a static website, we use a third party to handle form requests.

### Setup account & form

1. Go to https://app.99inbound.com/
2. Create a free account (note: use the email you want to receive contact messages to to sign up as you cannot change this after creating your account)
3. Go to Form End Points > Create a New End Point
4. Copy the End Point into the `formEndPoint` property in `data.json` in the contact section
5. Recommended to add the provided honeypot spam-protection div as well

# :art: Styling

This project uses SASS / SCSS.

- Easily update basic styling such as colors from `/src/styles/scss/_variables.scss`

- Only update the other partials if you know what you're doing

> In `src/styles/scss`, there are a number of folders and .scss files
>
> All of the files appended with `_` are imported into the `main.scss` file
>
> These get compiled into `src/styles/css/main.css` which is where the site css comes from

- In a terminal instance, run `npm run sass` to watch for changes to scss files and compile them into css

# :bell: Features

- Utilizes typewriter-effect npm package
- Add a list of facts about yourself in your About section
- Specify skills in different categories and your skill level that will fill the bar up the respective amount to your skill level
- Add filters for your portfolio projects
- Animations for each section on scroll
